<h1>Root Access with Chroot</h1>
<p>One night, I was tinkering around with my laptop doing an Archlinux
install (pretty typical night, isn’t it?) and I was reading through the
Archwiki page of the <strong>chroot</strong> command. If you’ve done an
Arch install, you know what’s <strong>chroot</strong>, but if you
didn’t, let me explain.</p>
<p><strong>chroot</strong> enables you to change the apparent root
directory for the current running process and their children. But what
the heck does this mean? I will tell you. Let’s consider a situation
where your <em>grub.cfg</em> file has been fucked up for some unknown
reason and you can’t boot into the system. You know that the system is
still there but you can’t boot into it because the bootloader is
missing. What would you do? Wouldn’t it be great if there was a way to
gain access to your OS without needing the bootloader at all? Then you
can fix it and get everything up and running again, right? This is what
<strong>chroot</strong> does. You boot your laptop using a bootable USB
stick, running Linux of course. Then, you mount the partition containing
the root directory of your OS. After that, you use the
<strong>chroot</strong> command to change root into the disk you just
mounted. Now, you have root privileges on this os without needing to
open it. From here, you can fix your laptop and get grub working
again.</p>
<p>My thought was: “What if, instead of using it to fix broken laptops,
I use it to break into laptops? Wouldn’t this work just fine?”. This was
it. I grabbed my USB and flashed Endeavour OS on it. I then shut down my
laptop and booted into the USB stick. I mounted the correct partition
and chrooted into it and voalá, I now have root privileges on my machine
without even needing to enter a single password.</p>
<p>I felt so powerful at this moment. I thought I have breached the
<em>Linux Security Myth</em>. Now, I can open anyone’s laptop and gain
root privileges and, from there, I can do lots of things, add a user for
me for example, to use his laptop without him knowing. Or I can change
his password and mess around with him. I can now <em>hack</em> into any
Linux machine that I have physical access to, right? Wrong.</p>
<p>The only possible way to stop such an attack is to encrypt your hard
disk (or your SSD if you can afford one xD). Encrypting will prevent
anyone random person from mounting your hard and reading it, thus
blocking any <strong>chroot</strong> attempt keeping you and your laptop
secure.</p>
<p>So, Kids, encrypt your disks and mess with your friends if you want
hehe.</p>
