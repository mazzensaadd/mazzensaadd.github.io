<h1>Virm</h1>
<p>
I am a CLI guy myself. Graphical user interfaces don't appeal to me that much. I always go for the terminal-based options instead of the GUI ones. For instance, I am now writing this blog post in vi while listening to Umm Kulthum through a cmus (a terminal-based music player as well).
The terminal-based options are just faster and more efficient for me.

When it comes to navigating the system and manipulating files and directories, I find myself using console file managers like nnn and ranger. But lately, I started relying on pure shell commands, cd and ls for instance. The only thing I missed about tui file managers was the bulk-rename and bulk-remove features. I started looking for alternatives for such features and I found <a href="https://github.com/thameera/vimv">vimv</a>. It lets you bulk-rename files using vim which is great because what I usually do when it comes to renaming is renaming episodes into more convenient names and vim helps get this job done very efficiently using macros.

The only thing that was missing is the Bulk-remove feature. So, I created <a href="https://github.com/mazzensaadd/virm">Virm</a>. It lets me use some vim magic and delete multiple files as if they were lines in text files. For me, this is much easier than following specific application's conventions every time I want to do a task. I know how to use vim, so let's use it everywhere xD.
