        <h2>Whoami?</h2>
        <p>
            A 19-year-old Computer Science student from Egypt.

        <h2>This website?</h2>
        <p><b><big>TL;DR</big></b> This place is my digital footprint.</p>
        <p>
        The Internet has evolved into something that it wasn't intended to be. In its first days, it was a magical place where people could enjoy their time without any bad consequences on them. But now, It has turned into a <em>matrix</em> where everyone is plugged without even realizing. People now are being controlled by some weirdos who managed to build monopolies that became so powerful that it took over the internet. Having such power made them able to hack into the human brain and tweak its behaviors towards their benefits, making us nothing but a bot in this big system.
        </p>
        <p>
        Hence, I decided to get unplugged. I realized that I have to step away from this shit to be able to live a normal life, the life humans were intended to live in the first place. I stopped using almost all social media platforms that were taking over my life. But being the zoomer I am, I had to find a place where I can rant about anything I want without the stupid "Community Guidelines" we all know about. So, as a consequence, I decided to build this website to keep the rant on-going.

        Here, you can find me talking about anything. Maybe how to setup a home server using an old laptop and stream movies from it or maybe how to make the perfect fries at 02:00 in the morning when your hungry but you don't want to eat the usual feta cheese sandwich.

        Enjoy :)
