<p>
Today, ladies and gentlemen, I will tell you my secret about how to win in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here's what you will need:
<ul>
    <li>grep</li>
    <li>basic understanding of regular expressions</li>
    <li>a text file containing every word in the english dictionary. I got mine <a href="http://www.gwicks.net/justwords.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
Wordle is a new puzzle that is played all over the world nowadays. In the game, you're asked to guess a 5-letter word that you have no idea what would it be. You have 6 trials. Each trial, you guess a word and the game tells you what letters are in the right position, what letters are in the word but are in the wrong position and what letters aren't in the word at all. You should use your vocabulary to eliminate words until you find the correct one. Otherwise, you lose the game for that day.
</p>

<h2>What if I am lazy but willing to win?</h2>

<p>
If the title fits you, we're similar. Here's how I did it so that I can win every game. This is tested on 11 different Wordle levels and I won them all. I can assure you that I had no idea what does the words mean but I still won.
</p>

<p>
First thing I did is getting an plain text English dictionary. Now, I have every word. I only need every 5-letter word letter right? Let's use 
grep to get this done.
</p>
<pre>
    <code>
$ grep "^.....$" dic.txt
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
Noice, now we have every 5-letter word. Let's guess the first word. After watching 3Blue1Brown talk about using information theory to play Wordle, I decide to use his opening word, <b>crane</b>. My first guess had three wrong letters and two right ones but not in the right position.
It looked like this.
<pre>
⬜🟨⬜🟨⬜
</pre>
I now know that the word contains 'r' and 'n' and doesn't contain 'c', 'a' or 'e'. Let's use this information. I filtered my words so that I get every word that contains 'r' and 'n' and doesn't contain any of [cae]. Here's the command that did so
<pre>
    <code>
$ grep "^.....$" english3.txt | grep r | grep n |grep -v "[cae]" | grep -v ".r..." | grep -v "...n."
    </code>
</pre>
Then, I used some common sense to choose a word to be my next guess. I guess this part can be optimized more but here's my convention: I
look at the first letter in every word and choose the most repeated one. In this case, it was 'b'. After that, I look for the second most repeated character. When I find it, I try to find a word that starts with the first most repeated letter and has the second letter in it. My choice was <b>Burin</b>. Of course, I have no idea what the hell does this means. The second guess looked like this:
<pre>
⬜⬜🟨⬜🟩
</pre>
Now, this is some progress. I now know that the word ends with 'n'. So, let's filter again.
<pre>
    <code>
grep "^....n$" english3.txt | grep r | grep n |grep -v "[caebui]" | grep -v ".r..." | grep -v "...n." | grep -v "..r.."
    </code>
</pre>
At this point, I still have 4 trails left and my computer is telling me that the only <em>four</em> possible words are "doorn", "shorn", "sworn" and "thorn". Let's use some common sense again and try to do it efficiently. What is the best word to choose in this case? My choice was "shorn" because if the first letter is wrong, I will eliminate "sworn" and if the second letter was wrong, I will eliminate "thorn".
I typed "shorn" and hit enter and here it was:
<pre>
⬜🟩🟩🟩🟩
</pre>
Every letter is perfectly right, except the first one. So I write the only world left that matches these criteria, "thorn", and hit enter. And voalá, I Won. Without knowing the meaning of any of the words mentioned except for "crane".
</p>

<p>
Here's the full thing from the Wordle website:
<pre>
Wordle 248 4/6

⬜🟨⬜🟨⬜
⬜⬜🟨⬜🟩
⬜🟩🟩🟩🟩
🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
</pre>
</p>

I am a CLI guy myself. Graphical user interfaces don't appeal to me that much. I always go for the terminal-based options instead of the GUI ones. For instance, I am now writing this blog post in vi while listening to Umm Kulthum through a cmus (a terminal-based music player as well).
The terminal-based options are just faster and more efficient for me. 
</p>

<p>
When it comes to navigating the system and manipulating files and directories, I find myself using console file managers like nnn and ranger. But lately, I started relying on pure shell commands, cd and ls for instance. The only thing I missed about tui file managers was the bulk-rename and bulk-remove features. I started looking for alternatives for such features and I found <a href="https://github.com/thameera/vimv">vimv</a>. It lets you bulk-rename files using vim which is great because what I usually do when it comes to renaming is renaming episodes into more convenient names and vim helps get this job done very efficiently using macros.
</p>

<p>
The only thing that was missing is the Bulk-remove feature. So, I created <a href="https://github.com/mazzensaadd/virm">Virm</a>. It lets me use some vim magic and delete multiple files as if they were lines in text files. For me, this is much easier than following specific application's conventions every time I want to do a task. I know how to use vim, so let's use it everywhere xD.

<title>Why 12-hour clock is stupid</title>

        One thing that I don't really understand about the world is how people can make it unnecessarily complicated. It seems like us human beings tend to make things harder for ourselves <em>cuz we can</em>. 
</p>
<p>
        Take the 12-hour clock system people use nowadays as an example. Why would any sufficiently working brain decide on dividing the 24 hours in the day into two 12s? By doing so, you are just adding more ambiguity to your lives. Now, people have to deal with A.M. and P.M. that they don't even know their meanings. Why would anyone assign a specific region of his brain to handle such stupid things? This is completely inefficient. Instead of doing this shit, just be a normal creature and divide your day into equal 24 parts and assign every one of them a number. Not only this will make it easier for kids and even adults to understand, but also it will solve the weird misunderstandings that arise from A.M. and P.M. conflicts.
</p>
<p>
        I myself have always had a problem with the clock system since I was a kid. It was hard to remember what is what when it comes to A.M. and P.M. and I have always thought that this is only adding a complicity layer on something that was supposed to be simple. I'd ask adults around me if A.M. meant night or day and, for some reason, I was never able to remember the difference after a while.
</p>
<p>
        The irony about the whole thing is that only a few portion people actually know what does A.M. and P.M. stand for. They both stand for the Latin words <em>"ante merīdiem"</em> and <em>"post merīdiem"</em> which I doubt that if I showed these words to anyone who uses the 12-hour format, he will be able to recognize it. 
</p>
<p>
        I am using the 24-hour everywhere. My laptop, my phone, my watch, even this website is using the 24-hour system as a clock system. It's easier for me and helps preserve my brain computing power to be used in something more significant.
</p>
<p>
        Please help the world become a better place and start using 24-hour clock. Peace out!
</p>
